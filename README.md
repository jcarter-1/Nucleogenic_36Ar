Nucleogenic production of argon 36 and its effect on 40Ar/39Ar ages 

Various interference reactions producing unwanted Ar isotopes from K, Ca, Cl and Ar need to be corrected for to satisfy the 40Ar/39Ar age equation. The production of 36Ar by the   reaction 39K(n,)36Cl followed by beta decay (39K(n,,) 36Ar) is currently overlooked in widely used data reduction protocols. Simulations in this work using a 235U fission neutron energy spectrum determine a production ratio for this reaction (36Cl/39Ar)K =  0.4  0.01 (1); greater than an order of magnitude larger than any other K interference. The magnitude of the resulting age bias for an unknown sample will be a function of the integrated neutron flux, the length of irradiation (fluence), the time elapsed since irradiation, and the age relationship between the unknown and standard. We show using the raw data of (Niespolo et al. 2017) that the age of Alder Creek sanidine can be modified to be ca. 0.1% older (1), at the 2 level of current analytical precision for this measurement. The 39K(n,$\alpha$,)36Ar inference should be incorporated into routine data analysis and may be especially important in the intercalibration of the 40Ar/39Ar system with other chronometers (e.g., 206Pb/238U).
